# Machine Learning project - Predictive Modeling for Anticipating Flight Delays

This project shows that an important application of machine learning models is predicting flight delays to assist businesses to diagnose operational problems and improve customer service. Airline businesses have various independent factors to consider, such as flight destination, flight origin, weather, day of the week, etc. In this project, three algorithms – namely K-NN, Naïve Bayes, and Linear Discriminant Analysis – have been tested to model relationships between independent factors and flight delays. Test results show the best performance by the K-NN classifier which has an overall accuracy of 71% but correctly predicts 86% of actual flight delays.
